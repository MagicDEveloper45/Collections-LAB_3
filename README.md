# Collections-LAB_3
Compare the performance of ArrayList and LinkedList  You need to write code that would call the main methods of collections a certain (1000 or 2000, or any other) number of times. At the same time, the time must be recorded.  Minimally necessary to test the methods:add, delete, get  After that, output a table with the results(method, how many times it was executed, execution time)
